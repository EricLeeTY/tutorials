### 3. Submit your solution

- Once you've finished the lab, please compress your code into a tarball and submit it to JOJ. For Lab One, Exercise One, the tarball contains only `ex1.sh`. You can make it with the following command in your terminal: 

  ```
  tar -cvf ex1.tar ex1.sh
  ```

- __Note__ that the problem is not visible till the time it releases. Open the project page again and click Problem #1: "Lab 1 Ex1: Scripting Web Server".

### 4. View the submission result

- After your submission, the grading results will be automatically displayed. If your solution is not "Accepted" for any test case, please try to debug and improve your solution, then submit it again. You have unlimited chances for submission. Please notice this is only a pretest with 5 test cases. After the due date of Lab One, TAs will run the complete test suite which contains other cases. We strongly encourage you to design your own test suite and take every corner case into consideration. Good Luck!
